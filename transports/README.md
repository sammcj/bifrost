## 🚀 Setting Up Transports

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.23 or higher (if not using Docker)
- Access to at least one AI model provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- API keys for the providers you wish to use

### Configuration

Bifrost uses a combination of a JSON configuration file and environment variables:

1. **JSON Configuration File**: Bifrost requires a configuration file to set up the gateway. This includes all your provider-level settings, keys, and meta configs for each of your providers.
   
2. **Environment Variables**: If you don't want to include your keys in your config file, you can provide a `.env` file and add a prefix of `env.` followed by its key in your `.env` file. 

```json
{
  "keys": [{
    "value": "env.OPENAI_API_KEY",
    "models": ["gpt-4o-mini", "gpt-4-turbo"],
    "weight": 1.0
  }]
}
```

In this example, `OPENAI_API_KEY` refers to a key in the `.env` file. At runtime, its value will be used to replace the placeholder.

The same setup applies to keys in meta configs of all providers:

```json
{
  "meta_config": {
    "secret_access_key": "env.BEDROCK_ACCESS_KEY",
    "region": "env.BEDROCK_REGION"
  }
}
```

In this example, `BEDROCK_ACCESS_KEY` and `BEDROCK_REGION` refer to keys in the `.env` file.

Please refer to `config.example.json` and `.env.sample` for examples.

### Docker Setup

You can run Bifrost using our **independent Dockerfile**. Just copy our Dockerfile and run these commands to get your Bifrost instance up and running:

```bash
docker build \
  --build-arg CONFIG_PATH=./config.example.json \
  --build-arg ENV_PATH=./.env.sample \
  --build-arg PORT=8080 \
  --build-arg POOL_SIZE=300 \
  -t bifrost-transports .

docker run -p 8080:8080 bifrost-transports
```

You can also add a flag for `DROP_EXCESS_REQUESTS=false` in your Docker build command to drop excess requests when the buffer is full. Read more about `DROP_EXCESS_REQUESTS` and `POOL_SIZE` [here](https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost/tree/main?tab=README-ov-file#additional-configurations).

### Go Setup

If you wish to run Bifrost in your Go environment, follow these steps:

1. Install your binary:

```bash
go install github.com/maximhq/bifrost/transports/http@latest
```

2. Run your binary:

- If it's in your PATH:
```bash
http -config config.json -env .env -port 8080 -pool-size 300
```

- Otherwise:
```bash
./http -config config.json -env .env -port 8080 -pool-size 300
```

You can also add a flag for `-drop-excess-requests=false` in your command to drop excess requests when the buffer is full. Read more about `DROP_EXCESS_REQUESTS` and `POOL_SIZE` [here](https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost/tree/main?tab=README-ov-file#additional-configurations).

## 🧰 Usage

Ensure that:
- Bifrost's HTTP server is running
- The providers/models you use are configured in your JSON config file

### Text Completions

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/text/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "text": "Once upon a time in the land of AI,",
    "params": {
      "temperature": 0.7,
      "max_tokens": 100
    }
  }'
```

### Chat Completions

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "provider": "openai",
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about Bifrost in Norse mythology."}
    ],
    "params": {
      "temperature": 0.8,
      "max_tokens": 500
    }
  }'
```

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Fallbacks

Configure fallback options in your requests:

```json
{
  "provider": "openai",
  "model": "gpt-4",
  "messages": [...],
  "fallbacks": [
    {
      "provider": "anthropic",
      "model": "claude-3-opus-20240229"
    },
    {
      "provider": "bedrock",
      "model": "anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0"
    }
  ]
}
```
