# Bifrost Governance Plugin

The Bifrost Governance Plugin provides comprehensive access control, usage tracking, and cost management for your AI infrastructure. It enables you to control who can access what models, set spending limits, and track usage across your organization.

## 🎯 What is Governance?

Governance in Bifrost ensures that:

- **Only authorized users** can access your AI models
- **Spending stays within budget** through hierarchical cost controls
- **Usage is tracked and monitored** for accountability
- **Rate limits prevent abuse** and ensure fair resource allocation

## 🏗️ Core Concepts

### Virtual Keys (VKs)
Virtual Keys are the fundamental unit of access control in Bifrost. Think of them as "API keys with superpowers":

- **Authentication**: Each request must include a valid Virtual Key
- **Authorization**: VKs can be restricted to specific models and providers
- **Cost Control**: VKs have spending limits and budgets
- **Rate Limiting**: VKs can have request rate limits
- **Usage Tracking**: All usage is tracked per Virtual Key

Virtual Keys replace your real provider API keys in client applications. Instead of exposing your actual OpenAI or Anthropic keys, you distribute Virtual Keys that Bifrost manages.

### Teams
Teams provide organizational structure and budget allocation:

- **Hierarchical Organization**: Teams can have parent-child relationships
- **Budget Management**: Teams have spending limits that cascade to children
- **Member Management**: Control which users belong to which teams
- **Resource Allocation**: Distribute AI resources across teams

### Customers
Customers represent top-level entities in your organization:

- **Multi-tenancy**: Isolate resources between different customers/organizations
- **Billing Aggregation**: Track costs and usage per customer
- **Global Policies**: Apply organization-wide policies and limits

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Enable the Governance Plugin

```bash
# Enable governance in your Bifrost configuration
bifrost-http --plugins governance
```

### 2. Create a Customer

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/governance/customers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Organization",
    "budget_limit_usd": 1000.0,
    "rate_limit_rpm": 10000
  }'
```

### 3. Create a Team

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/governance/teams \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Engineering Team",
    "customer_id": "customer_123",
    "budget_limit_usd": 500.0,
    "rate_limit_rpm": 5000
  }'
```

### 4. Create a Virtual Key

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/governance/virtual_keys \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Frontend App Key",
    "team_id": "team_456",
    "budget_limit_usd": 100.0,
    "rate_limit_rpm": 1000,
    "allowed_models": ["openai/gpt-4o-mini", "anthropic/claude-3-sonnet"]
  }'
```

### 5. Use the Virtual Key

```python
import openai

# Use your Virtual Key instead of real API key
client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8080/openai",
    api_key="vk_abc123..."  # Your Virtual Key
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, world!"}]
)
```
