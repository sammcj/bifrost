<Update label="Bifrost(HTTP)" description="v1.3.0">

We're excited to ship v1.3.0 with major quality, compatibility, and governance upgrades across OSS and Enterprise. 

🌟 Highlights
- OTel traces support (OSS): First-class support for OTLP collectors.  
- Responses API (OSS): First-class support for the OpenAI-style Responses format, streaming + non-streaming.
- Drop-in for LiteLLM (OSS): Config-level fallbacks to ease migrations.
- Guardrails (Enterprise): Initial set with AWS Bedrock, Azure Content Moderator, and Patronus AI.
- Provisioning (Enterprise): Okta SCIM now supported alongside Microsoft Entra.
- Adaptive LB Dashboard (Enterprise, beta): Live traffic, weight shifts, and failover visibility.

### Features
- Added Anthropic thinking parameter in Responses API.
- Added Anthropic text completion integration support.
- Latency metrics for all request types now returned in extra (includes inter-token latency for streaming).
- TokenInterceptor interface added to plugins.
- Raw provider response saved in logs (framework v1.1.4).

### Fixes

- Removed extra fields erroneously sent in streaming responses.
- Anthropic tool results aggregation corrected (core v1.2.4).
- String input support fixed for Responses requests.
- Specific timeout error handling across all providers for context.Canceled, context.DeadlineExceeded, and fasthttp.ErrTimeout.
- Pricing manager fixes.

### Improvements

- CORS wildcard matching improved to support domain patterns like *.example.com.
