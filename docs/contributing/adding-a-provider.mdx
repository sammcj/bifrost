This guide will walk you through creating a provider for Bifrost, testing locally and adding automated tests.

## Setup

We assume you have some idea about how Bifrost works and you have already [set up bifrost for local development](setting-up-repo).

## Provider structure

Bifrost is a gateway, meaning it receives request in a standard format (OpenAI compatible), converts it to provider specific formats and sends the request. It then receives the provider response and converts it back to the standard (OpenAI compatible) response.

To implement a new provider, you must roughly follow these steps:
- Define provider specific types, like `ProviderSpeechRequest` or `ProviderChatCompletionRequest`, etc.
- Implement conversion functions from Bifrost request / response to provider specific request / response and vice versa.
- Implement the handler functions for the type of request you want to handle. For example, to handle chat completion requests, you need to implement `ChatCompletion` functions. You can check the [full list of handlers](https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost/blob/main/core/schemas/provider.go) here.

We will go through each step in detail. But first, here is the directory structure:

```text
bifrost/
└─ core/                 # Core functionality and shared components
    ├── providers/       # Provider-specific implementations (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
    ├── schemas/         # Interfaces and structs used throughout Bifrost
    └── bifrost.go       # Main Bifrost implementation
```

Add provider specific types in types.go (see `core/providers/openai/types.go` for an example).

### OpenAI Compatible Providers

If you are implementing a provider for an OpenAI API compatible API, you can use the `openai` package from `core/providers/openai`. (See [cerebras](https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost/blob/main/core/providers/cerebras.go) provider as an example.)

### Extra fields

When parsing request, all non standard fields are stored in `Params.ExtraParams` map. This is useful for providers that require additional fields that are not part of OpenAI API. (See [perplexity provider](https://github.com/maximhq/bifrost/tree/main/core/providers/perplexity) as an example).

## Local testing

Once you're done writing the provider, you may want to test it locally before writing some automated tests. We will setup a new go project and import our provider.

```bash
go mod init bifrost-test
go get github.com/maximhq/bifrost/core
go mod tidy
```

Replace `github.com/maximhq/bifrost/core` with your local path to the core (relative path).

```text
// add this line at the end of go.mod
replace github.com/maximhq/bifrost/core => ../path-to-bifrost/core
```

Now you can test your provide by importing it as a Go SDK. This guide explains [how to use Bifrost as a Go SDK](/quickstart/go-sdk/setting-up) in further detail.

# Adding automated tests

Create a new file in `tests/core-providers` directory and enable tests for all the provider function you have implemented (like `Speech`, `SpeechStream`, `Embeddings`, etc.).
