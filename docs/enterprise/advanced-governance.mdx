## Overview

Enterprise Governance extends Bifrost's [core governance capabilities](../features/governance) with advanced security, compliance, and user management features designed for large-scale enterprise deployments. This module provides comprehensive identity management, regulatory compliance, and detailed audit capabilities.

**Enterprise Extensions:**
- **Identity & Access Management** - OpenID Connect integration with Okta and Microsoft Entra
- **User-Level Governance** - Individual user authentication and budget allocation
- **[Role-Based Access Control](./rbac)** - Fine-grained permissions with custom roles and resource-level controls
- **Team Synchronization** - Automatic team membership based on identity provider groups
- **Compliance Framework** - SOC 2 Type II, GDPR, ISO 27001, and HIPAA compliance
- **Advanced Auditing** - Comprehensive audit reports and compliance dashboards

**Builds Upon Core Governance:**
- All standard [Virtual Keys, Teams, and Customers](../features/governance) functionality
- Hierarchical budget management and rate limiting
- Model and provider access controls
- Usage tracking and cost management

---

## Identity Provider Integration

Bifrost Enterprise supports OpenID Connect (OIDC) integration with popular identity providers for single sign-on (SSO) authentication. Users are automatically provisioned on first login, with roles and team memberships synchronized from your identity provider.

**Supported Identity Providers:**
- **[Okta](./setting-up-okta)** - Full OIDC integration with custom roles and group sync
- **[Microsoft Entra ID](./setting-up-entra)** - Azure AD integration with app roles and group claims

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic User Provisioning** - Users are created on first SSO login
- **Role Synchronization** - Admin, Developer, and Viewer roles mapped from identity provider
- **Team Membership** - Groups from your identity provider automatically create and sync teams
- **Secure Token Handling** - JWT validation with automatic token refresh

### Role Hierarchy

Bifrost uses a three-tier role hierarchy that maps to your identity provider roles:

| Role | Privilege Level | Description |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Highest | Full access to all Bifrost features and settings |
| **Developer** | Medium | Access to development features, API keys, and logs |
| **Viewer** | Lowest | Read-only access to dashboards and reports |

When a user has multiple roles, Bifrost automatically assigns the highest privilege role.

For detailed information on managing roles and permissions, including creating custom roles and assigning granular permissions, see [Role-Based Access Control](./rbac).

### Configuration

Identity provider configuration is done through the Bifrost UI:

1. Navigate to **Governance** → **User Provisioning** in the Bifrost dashboard
2. Select your identity provider (Okta or Microsoft Entra)
3. Enter the required credentials from your identity provider
4. Enable the provider and save

For detailed setup instructions, see the provider-specific guides:
- **[Setting up Okta](./setting-up-okta)**
- **[Setting up Microsoft Entra](./setting-up-entra)**

## User-Level Authentication & Budgeting

Enterprise Governance extends the hierarchical governance model to include individual user-level controls, providing granular access management and personalized budget allocation.

### User Management

**Enhanced Hierarchy:**
```
Customer (organization-level budget)
    ↓
Team (department-level budget)
    ↓  
User (individual-level budget + authentication)
    ↓
Virtual Key (API-level budget + rate limits)
```

**User Features:**
- **Individual Authentication** - SSO-based login credentials
- **Personal Budgets** - User-specific cost allocation
- **Access Controls** - Per-user model and provider restrictions
- **Usage Tracking** - Individual consumption monitoring
- **Audit Trails** - User-specific activity logging

### User Authentication Flow

**SSO Authentication:**
```bash
# 1. User visits Bifrost login page
# 2. Redirected to identity provider (Okta/Entra)
# 3. After successful authentication, redirected back with tokens
# 4. Use access token for API requests

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

**Virtual Key with User Context:**
```bash
# Use virtual key with user tracking
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "x-bf-vk: vk-alice-personal" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
  }'
```

## Compliance Framework

Enterprise Governance includes built-in compliance capabilities for major regulatory frameworks including **SOC 2 Type II**, **GDPR**, **ISO 27001**, and **HIPAA** compliance. These features provide automated compliance monitoring, policy enforcement, and audit trail generation to meet enterprise security and regulatory requirements.
