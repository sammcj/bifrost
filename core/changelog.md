- feat: **Bedrock: Adaptive thinking support for Opus 4.6+** - Correctly separates `thinking.type: "adaptive"` and `output_config.effort` fields in the payload (previously `effort` was incorrectly nested under `thinking`)
- feat: **Bedrock: Extended document format support** - Added support for markdown (`.md`), HTML, CSV, DOC/DOCX, and XLS/XLSX file types in both request and response handling
- feat: **Bedrock: GuardrailConfig streamProcessingMode** - Added optional `streamProcessingMode` field for sync/async guardrail processing
- feat: **Bedrock: CachePoint support** - Added `CachePoint` schema type and handling for standalone cache point blocks in system and content messages
- feat: **Bedrock: Native format compatibility** - Handle requests where `type` field is empty but `text` is set directly (Bedrock native format from Claude Code)
- **feat: Bedrock: Multi-turn reasoning support** - Added `ReasoningDetails` handling in assistant messages for multi-turn conversations with thinking
- fix: **Bedrock: Adaptive thinking payload structure** - Fixed Opus 4.6+ adaptive thinking where `effort` was incorrectly placed under `thinking` instead of `output_config`
- fix: **Bedrock: Stop reason conversion** - Created dedicated Bedrock stop reason converter instead of reusing Anthropic's, properly handling Bedrock-specific reasons like `guardrail_intervened` and `content_filtered`
- fix: **Bedrock: ToolChoice auto handling** - Return `nil` for `auto` tool choice (Bedrock's default) instead of failing
- fix: **Bedrock: Stop reason mapping** - Now uses own `bedrockFinishReasonToBifrost` map with Bedrock-specific stop reasons (`guardrail_intervened` -> `content_filter`, `content_filtered` -> `content_filter`)
